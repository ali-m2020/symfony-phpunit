# symfony-phpunit
This is a simple Yahoo Finance API command tool built using Symfony under TDD approach.

In order to get it to work, after pulling the project to your local machine, create a .env.local inside the root dir of the application
and insert your rapid api key like so:
RAPID_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY

P.S. Credit goes to Gary Clark for his tutorial on TDD in Symfony.
